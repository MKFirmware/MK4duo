# MK4duo 3D Printer Firmware for all Atmel AVR boards and Arduino Due
Version 4.3.2x development.

### New features are:
* One version for all Atmel AVR boards and for Arduino Due or other boards based on Atmel SAM3X8E
* Stepping-algorithm optmized now for DRV8825 and A4988 (no need for double or quadstepping; no delays)
* High speed stepping of approx. 295.000 steps/s, if needed (maybe more with less DOUBLE_STEP_FREQUENCY?)

* The addition of the 6th extruder.
* Management Color Mixing Extruder
* System Management MKr4 for 4 extruders width just two drivers and 8 relay.
* System Management MKr6 for 6 extruders width just two drivers and 8 relay.
* System Management MKr12 for 12 extruders width just four drivers and 16 relay.
* Management Multyextruder NPr2, 4/6 extruders with only two engines.
* Management Dual Extruder DONDOLO.
* Step per unit varied for each extruder as well as the feedrate and the acceleration.
* Added commands to facilitate purging of hotend. 
* Added Delta Auto Calibration Algorithm of Minor Squares based on DC42 RepRapFirmware 7 points
