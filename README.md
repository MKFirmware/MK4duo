# MK4duo 3D Printer Firmware for all Atmel AVR boards and Arduino Due

## Version 4.3.6.

### New features are:
* One version for all Atmel AVR boards and for Arduino Due or other boards based on Atmel SAM3X8E
* Stepping-algorithm optmized now for DRV8825 and A4988 (no need for double or quadstepping; no delays)
* High speed stepping of approx. 295.000 steps/s, if needed (maybe more with less DOUBLE_STEP_FREQUENCY?)

## Quick Information

This version of Marlin was made to accommodate some requests made by the community RepRap Italy http://forums.reprap.org/index.php?349

The new features are:
* A single Firmware for all types of printers; Cartesian, Delta, MORGAN SCARA, MAKERARM SCARA, CoreXY, CoreXZ & CoreYZ and their reverse.
* The possibility of having only one hotend independently from the extruders that you have.
* The addition of the 6th extruder.
* Management Color Mixing Extruder
* System Management MKr4 for 4 extruders width just two drivers and 8 relay.
* System Management MKr6 for 6 extruders width just two drivers and 8 relay.
* System Management MKr12 for 12 extruders width just four drivers and 16 relay.
* Management Dual Extruder DONDOLO.
* Step per unit varied for each extruder as well as the feedrate and the acceleration.
* Added commands to facilitate purging of hotend.
